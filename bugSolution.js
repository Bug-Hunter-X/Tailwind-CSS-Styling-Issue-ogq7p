// Solution might involve checking for conflicting CSS rules, ensuring correct Tailwind configuration,
// or using the `!important` flag as a last resort.
// For example, if the background color isn't applied, check for a more specific selector overriding it.

// Check Tailwind Configuration
// Ensure that your Tailwind configuration file (tailwind.config.js) is properly configured and contains the correct paths to your CSS files.

// Check CSS specificity
// Check for more specific selectors in your CSS that might override the Tailwind classes.  If you use other CSS frameworks, there might be a conflict

// Use !important (as a last resort)
// If the above steps don't work, you can try using the !important flag as a last resort (this isn't recommended, as it can make your CSS harder to maintain). 
<div class="bg-gray-100 p-4 !important">
  <p class="text-xl font-bold !important">This is some text</p>
</div>
