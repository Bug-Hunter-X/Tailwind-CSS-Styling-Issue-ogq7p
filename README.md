# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS.  The issue involves unexpected styling behavior.  The `bug.js` file contains the code exhibiting the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a possible solution.

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
3.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4.  Run your preferred build command (e.g., `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, depending on the Tailwind configuration in your project). 

## Problem Description

The styles from `bug.js` will display inconsistently, with the correct classes showing unexpected results in the final rendered output. This is different from common typos or missing dependencies.
